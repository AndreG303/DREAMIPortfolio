 Using Bootstrap, I've developed a portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * Functional, deployed application
   
   * Consistent Navbar on each page

   * Semantic and valid HTML
   
   * Navbar on each page containing links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages

   * Bootstrap components and grid system
